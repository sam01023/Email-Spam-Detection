This project uses a **fine-tuned BERT model** to classify emails as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam).  
It includes:

- Preprocessing of email content  
- Tokenization using HuggingFace `transformers`  
- Training and evaluation with `Trainer API`  
- Aesthetic **Streamlit** frontend with dark-mode input box  
- Git LFS support for heavy model files
